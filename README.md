# AdventureGame
A text based Python adventure game
# Currently working on...
Playtesting... I keep running across errors.  Feel free to find them and submit a pull request, I'll merge it.
#Any ideas?
If there's anything you'd like to add, feel free to submit a pull request.
# Running
## Note that to run the SH you need to give it permission. (assuming you're in the directory you want to run it from)
```
chmod +x ./play.sh

./play.sh
```
For windows, you can just run it:
```
play.bat
```
## Either way, you need to install Python3.
You can run it on either:
```
python3 play.py
```
Note: This is a beta test. I have made menus for this, so yeah. Try it!
