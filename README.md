A text based Python adventure game
# Currently working on...
Playtesting... I keep running across errors.  Feel free to find them and submit a pull request, I'll merge it.
#Any ideas?
If there's anything you'd like to add, feel free to submit a pull request.
# Running
```
./play.sh
```
For windows, you can just run it:
```
play.bat
```
## Either way, you need to install Python3.
You can run it on either:
```
python3 play.py
```
