# AdventureGame
A text based Python adventure game
# Currently working on...
Playtesting... I keep running across errors.  Feel free to find them and submit a pull request, I'll merge it.
#Any ideas?
If there's anything you'd like to add, feel free to submit a pull request.
# Running
```
./play.sh
```
For windows, you can just run it:
```
play.bat
```
Currently, the menu only works for UNIX/OS X/Linux.
## Either way, you need to install Python3.
You can run it on either:
```
python3 play.py
```
Note: This is a beta test. I have made menus for this, so yeah. Try it!
